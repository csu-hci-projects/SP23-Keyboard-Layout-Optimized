I spent this week finding examples of virtual keyboards on the web and taking what is necessary to get a functioning keyboard working. I implemented a QWERTY style keyboard as a starting point for the other keyboards that we will need to implement for the experiment. Once we get the QWERTY keyboard to the style that we intend to use for the experiment we will create clones of it for the other keyboard variants that will be made.

I spent the the past this weeks trying to figure out how to change the background color of the key to make vowels more easily visible to the users. Its the saame  QWERTY layout but the only difference here would be vowels having background color which will be changed in the future to hightlight next letter for the words

I spent this week looking at different keyboard layouts that could be more optimal than the QWERTY layout. I ended up choosing the Dvorak layout as there are many resources online for it. After completing the Dvorak layout I began to test it to find any issues so that they do not interfere with the experimentation.
