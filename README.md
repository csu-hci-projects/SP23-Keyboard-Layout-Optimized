I spent this week finding examples of virtual keyboards on the web and taking what is necessary to get a functioning keyboard working. I implemented a QWERTY style keyboard as a starting point for the other keyboards that we will need to implement for the experiment. Once we get the QWERTY keyboard to the style that we intend to use for the experiment we will create clones of it for the other keyboard variants that will be made.
