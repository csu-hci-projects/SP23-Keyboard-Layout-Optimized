I spent this week finding examples of virtual keyboards on the web and taking what is necessary to get a functioning keyboard working. I implemented a QWERTY style keyboard as a starting point for the other keyboards that we will need to implement for the experiment. Once we get the QWERTY keyboard to the style that we intend to use for the experiment we will create clones of it for the other keyboard variants that will be made.

Its the saame  QWERTY layout but the only difference here would be vowels having background color which will be changed in the future to hightlight next letter for the words
